<h1>  Introduction to datascience </h1>
   <p> Data-science is a collection of  scientific methods and processes It is a combination of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge. data science is used to gain data about a specific topic .</p>
  <p> key elements of data science:</p>
  <li> statical analysis </li>
 <li>machine learning</li> <li>data visualization</li>  <li>data decision making </li>
                                                                             
<h1>  Importance of datascience </h1>
<p> â—¦ if we take from a small project.first we need the details of the project that we will be going to make .without any data we cannot make that project.so data science plays major role in any thing or research we have to study different theories and collect that data from them . </p>
<p> examples of industries that use data science is (health-care,finance,marketing and technology </p>
     <h1> Processes of Data-science </h1>  
     <p> <li> Data-collection </li> 
   <li> data cleansing and preprocessing </li>                                         
    <li> statical analysis and modeling </li>                                                         
    <li> maching learning and predictive modeling </li>                  
     <li> data visualization and communication </li>                                            
  <li> developing data-driven solutios to real world problems </li> 
  
  <h1> Data science Skills </h1>
  <p> these skills required to make career in data-science.
  <li> analytical and critical  thinking. </li>
    <li> problem-solving </li>
      <li> programming and data-manipulation </li>
        <li> statical knowledge and modeling </li>
          <li> maching learning and ai knowledge </li>
  </p>
  
   <h1> Career opportunities </h1>
  <p> in todays world if we see everything needs for starting anything they must have a background of this thing that they wil be making.
  <li> data-analyst </li>
    <li> data scientist </li>
      <li> maching learning engineer </li>
        <li> business inteligent analyst </li>
          <li> big data architect </li>
  </p>
  
  <h1> Conclusion </h1>
  <p> every project or work that we will be dealing with  a bunch of data to collect first and after that we can work on that data .data-science helos us to make our data collection method easy.by applying all the processes of data science things can be easy for making and research on specific project.
   
   # PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
   # Functions
   we have studied about the functions.for creating of functions we write def which means that it is user made
   and then we gave it the name we want ,braces then we have the choice that either we have parameters in it or make it empty and after that we use ':' this sign and then the main section comes here we write the code or logic we want to make.
   
   # Types and Sequences:
   Type is used to return the object type means that it tells us that whether it is int,float etc .in the sequences
   section we have started from tuples which is immutable datastructure how to create tuples.after that we have studied about the 
   list  which is a mutable data-structure.we studied about that how to show a spicific word location from there by using x[0] suppose.in that section we have also studied about append which is used to add an object to a list string or integer.
   we have also studied about the while how it can be used and how to perform different operation or add different logics form it.
   we have studied about concatenation of a list mean to combine to list together .also studied about the '*' sign means 
   to check whether a specific string or int is in the the list.in that topic we have also studied the slicing concept by using the bracket notation .we tell the staring index and the ending index if necessory and then it shows only those results.
   also in that section we studied about the the split concept which returns all the words in a string or it will remain on specific charachter.we studied also about the dictionaries.
In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as an associative array or a hash map in other programming languages. Dictionaries are mutable, unordered, and indexed containers.

Each element in a dictionary consists of two parts: a key and a corresponding value.
   # More on strings
   
String formatting in Python refers to the process of constructing strings by inserting values into predefined placeholders within the string. It allows you to create dynamic strings that incorporate variables, expressions, or other values.
   # Reading and Writting CSV files:
   suppose if we have a large dataset which is in excel.for importing that data into out code we use the csv concept .first we import it  the we give the location where the data is stored and then we dictreader which has read in each row of the csv file.len concepts tell that our list is made up of many dictionaries.keys concept gives us the column names of our csv.in that section we studied the 'set' which returns unique values for our class types in dataset.
   
   # Dates And Time:
   we can use the python dates and time for checking the current date and time.we import date and time from python libraries and by giving the specific function name we can find the date and time .
   for-example:
   date.today return the current date and alot more we can use.
   
   # Numpy
   We have studied the numpy packkage in python.this numpy helps us to create powerfull ways to create,store and manipulate our data.it makes it speedy to integrate with a wide variety of databases.also the foundation that pandas is built.numpy package helps us to create arrays ,selecting elements of arrays and loading the dataset into the array.
   # Array-Creation
   array can be diplayed like a list or a list of lists we pass in a list as argument in array.
   we can display the by first importing the numpy package and then we have to declare the variable we want and equal it to, and then square braces and the values and inserting it into it.
   for using multidimentsional array we have to use the double time square braces and passing the value into it.we can find the datatype the array elements by using the 'dtype' in it.by using shape attribute we can find the length of each dimension by calling the shape attribute.Arrays gives us several functions to create arrays by writting onews with it and giving the rows and columns names into it .array can be created which will be showing only the ones values in it.also we can use the zeros in it and zeros array can also be created .
