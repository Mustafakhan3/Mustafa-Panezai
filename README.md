<h1>  Importance of datascience </h1>
<p> â—¦ if we take from a small project.first we need the details of the project that we will be going to make .without any data we cannot make that project.so data science plays major role in any thing or research we have to study different theories and collect that data from them . </p>
<p> examples of industries that use data science is (health-care,finance,marketing and technology </p>
     <h1> Processes of Data-science </h1>  
     <p> <li> Data-collection </li> 
   <li> data cleansing and preprocessing </li>                                         
    <li> statical analysis and modeling </li>                                                         
    <li> maching learning and predictive modeling </li>

  <h1> Conclusion </h1>
  <p> every project or work that we will be dealing with  a bunch of data to collect first and after that we can work on that data .data-science helos us to make our data collection method easy.by applying all the processes of data science things can be easy for making and research on specific project.
   
   # PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
   # Functions
   we have studied about the functions.for creating of functions we write def which means that it is user made
   and then we gave it the name we want ,braces then we have the choice that either we have parameters in it or make it empty and after that we use ':' this sign and then the main section comes here we write the code or logic we want to make.
   
   # Types and Sequences:
   Type is used to return the object type means that it tells us that whether it is int,float etc .in the sequences
   section we have started from tuples which is immutable datastructure how to create tuples.after that we have studied about the 
   list  which is a mutable data-structure.we studied about that how to show a spicific word location from there by using x[0] suppose.in that section we have also studied about append which is used to add an object to a list string or integer.
   we have also studied about the while how it can be used and how to perform different operation or add different logics form it.
   we have studied about concatenation of a list mean to combine to list together .also studied about the '*' sign means 
   to check whether a specific string or int is in the the list.in that topic we have also studied the slicing concept by using the bracket notation .we tell the staring index and the ending index if necessory and then it shows only those results.
   also in that section we studied about the the split concept which returns all the words in a string or it will remain on specific charachter.we studied also about the dictionaries.
In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as an associative array or a hash map in other programming languages. Dictionaries are mutable, unordered, and indexed containers.

Each element in a dictionary consists of two parts: a key and a corresponding value.
   # More on strings
   
String formatting in Python refers to the process of constructing strings by inserting values into predefined placeholders within the string. It allows you to create dynamic strings that incorporate variables, expressions, or other values.
   # Reading and Writting CSV files:
   suppose if we have a large dataset which is in excel.for importing that data into out code we use the csv concept .first we import it  the we give the location where the data is stored and then we dictreader which has read in each row of the csv file.len concepts tell that our list is made up of many dictionaries.keys concept gives us the column names of our csv.in that section we studied the 'set' which returns unique values for our class types in dataset.
   
   # Dates And Time:
   we can use the python dates and time for checking the current date and time.we import date and time from python libraries and by giving the specific function name we can find the date and time .
   for-example:
   date.today return the current date and alot more we can use.
   
   # Numpy
   We have studied the numpy packkage in python.this numpy helps us to create powerfull ways to create,store and manipulate our data.it makes it speedy to integrate with a wide variety of databases.also the foundation that pandas is built.numpy package helps us to create arrays ,selecting elements of arrays and loading the dataset into the array.
   # Array-Creation
   array can be diplayed like a list or a list of lists we pass in a list as argument in array.
   we can display the by first importing the numpy package and then we have to declare the variable we want and equal it to, and then square braces and the values and inserting it into it.
   for using multidimentsional array we have to use the double time square braces and passing the value into it.we can find the datatype the array elements by using the 'dtype' in it.by using shape attribute we can find the length of each dimension by calling the shape attribute.Arrays gives us several functions to create arrays by writting onews with it and giving the rows and columns names into it .array can be created which will be showing only the ones values in it.also we can use the zeros in it and zeros array can also be created .we can also create random arrays by writting random.rand in it and random array will be created.we can also create array with arrange function which by giving the starting index ending index and the difference between the two values it can be created which is time saving.if we want flooat values in array it can be created by using the linspace function and starting index ending index and the differnece between the two values.
   #Array-Operations
   we can do many array operation like the addition subtraction exponents and as well as boolean arrays,inverse etc.for addition we have to declare two arrays and by defining the variables and then using  '-' this minus inbetween the two variables subtraction we be done.multiplication can also be done by using the * sign  between the two declared array variables.if we want to do element wise manipulation we use the * sign and if we want to do product wise manipulation we use the @ sign.shape function will help us to find the inner dimensions of the array.we can also find the dtype of array by using the var name of array and writting the dtype with it.numpy arrays have many intresting agregation functions on them such as sum(),max(),min(),mean().sum used for addition and max used for finding the maximum number in the  array.min for minumber number in the array.
   # Indexing,Slicing and Iterating
   # Indexing
   first lets look at integer indexing. to get an element in one dimensional array we use the offset value a[2[.
   but for multidimensional array we use integer array indexing for finding certain value in multidimensional array we have to use indexing like a[1,1] wher first shows the rows and second shows the column of which one to select.if we want to select multiple elements from array we can enter the indices directly into an array function.
   # Boolean Indexing
   boolean indexing allows us to select arbitrary elements based on conditions .if we want to get elements greater than 5 we will use the greater sigh a>5 .this will help us that the the value should be greater than 5.
   
   # Slicing
   slicing is a way to create a subarray based on the original array .to slice we use the : this sign .for examole if we want elements starting from index 2 and ending on index 4 we will use this command a[2:4].if we add another argument to the array a[:2,1:3] we get the first two rows and then the second and third column values only.
   
  # Trying Numpy with datasets
   we have learned the essentials of numpy lets use it on a couplle of datasets.to load a dataset in numpy we will use the genfromtxt we can also spicify datafile name ,delimeter.inside of the genfromtext bracket we have to give the location of the dataset. If we want a range of columns in order, say columns 0 through 3 (recall, this means first, second, and
 third, since we start at zero and don't include the training index value), we can do that too
wines[:, 0:3]. What if we want several non-consecutive columns? We can place the indices of the columns that we want into
 an array and pass the array as the second argument. Here's an example
wines[:, [0,2,4]]. Recall boolean masking. We can use this to find out how many students have had research experience by
 creating a boolean mask and passing it to the array indexing operator
len(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Research'] == 1])
   
   # Pandas Introduction
   lets look at the way that how to python can be used to manipulate clean and also query data by talking pandas toolkit.pandas created by wes Mckinny in 2008.pandas is a open source project under under a very permissive license.as an open source pandas has got a strong community.with many software developers all making code to help make it better.before pandas we have a hodge podge of tools numpy,the python core libraries.i want to introduce stack overflow pandas uses it as the number one resource for helping new members .if you post a question related to python or pandas the pandas community will respond and the will be given to your question.second resource you can use is that the book.wes mckinny wrote the book called pyrhon for data analysis and published by o'reilly and its recently updated to second verion.i consider this book to look for it.
