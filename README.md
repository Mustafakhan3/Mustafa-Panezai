   # PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
   # Functions
   we have studied about the functions.for creating of functions we write def which means that it is user made
   and then we gave it the name we want ,braces then we have the choice that either we have parameters in it or make it empty and after that we use ':' this sign and then the main section comes here we write the code or logic we want to make.
   
   # Types and Sequences:
   Type is used to return the object type means that it tells us that whether it is int,float etc .in the sequences
   section we have started from tuples which is immutable datastructure how to create tuples.after that we have studied about the 
   list  which is a mutable data-structure.we studied about that how to show a spicific word location from there by using x[0] suppose.in that section we have also studied about append which is used to add an object to a list string or integer.
   we have also studied about the while how it can be used and how to perform different operation or add different logics form it.
   we have studied about concatenation of a list mean to combine to list together .also studied about the '*' sign means 
   to check whether a specific string or int is in the the list.in that topic we have also studied the slicing concept by using the bracket notation .we tell the staring index and the ending index if necessory and then it shows only those results.
   also in that section we studied about the the split concept which returns all the words in a string or it will remain on specific charachter.we studied also about the dictionaries.
In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data type that represents a collection of key-value pairs. It is also known as an associative array or a hash map in other programming languages. Dictionaries are mutable, unordered, and indexed containers.

Each element in a dictionary consists of two parts: a key and a corresponding value.
   # More on strings
   
String formatting in Python refers to the process of constructing strings by inserting values into predefined placeholders within the string. It allows you to create dynamic strings that incorporate variables, expressions, or other values.
   # Reading and Writting CSV files:
   suppose if we have a large dataset which is in excel.for importing that data into out code we use the csv concept .first we import it  the we give the location where the data is stored and then we dictreader which has read in each row of the csv file.len concepts tell that our list is made up of many dictionaries.keys concept gives us the column names of our csv.in that section we studied the 'set' which returns unique values for our class types in dataset.
   
   # Dates And Time:
   we can use the python dates and time for checking the current date and time.we import date and time from python libraries and by giving the specific function name we can find the date and time .
   for-example:
   date.today return the current date and alot more we can use.
   
   # Numpy
   We have studied the numpy packkage in python.this numpy helps us to create powerfull ways to create,store and manipulate our data.it makes it speedy to integrate with a wide variety of databases.also the foundation that pandas is built.numpy package helps us to create arrays ,selecting elements of arrays and loading the dataset into the array.
   # Array-Creation
   array can be diplayed like a list or a list of lists we pass in a list as argument in array.
   we can display the by first importing the numpy package and then we have to declare the variable we want and equal it to, and then square braces and the values and inserting it into it.
   for using multidimentsional array we have to use the double time square braces and passing the value into it.we can find the datatype the array elements by using the 'dtype' in it.by using shape attribute we can find the length of each dimension by calling the shape attribute.Arrays gives us several functions to create arrays by writting onews with it and giving the rows and columns names into it .array can be created which will be showing only the ones values in it.also we can use the zeros in it and zeros array can also be created .we can also create random arrays by writting random.rand in it and random array will be created.we can also create array with arrange function which by giving the starting index ending index and the difference between the two values it can be created which is time saving.if we want flooat values in array it can be created by using the linspace function and starting index ending index and the differnece between the two values.
   #Array-Operations
   we can do many array operation like the addition subtraction exponents and as well as boolean arrays,inverse etc.for addition we have to declare two arrays and by defining the variables and then using  '-' this minus inbetween the two variables subtraction we be done.multiplication can also be done by using the * sign  between the two declared array variables.if we want to do element wise manipulation we use the * sign and if we want to do product wise manipulation we use the @ sign.shape function will help us to find the inner dimensions of the array.we can also find the dtype of array by using the var name of array and writting the dtype with it.numpy arrays have many intresting agregation functions on them such as sum(),max(),min(),mean().sum used for addition and max used for finding the maximum number in the  array.min for minumber number in the array.
   # Indexing,Slicing and Iterating
   # Indexing
   first lets look at integer indexing. to get an element in one dimensional array we use the offset value a[2[.
   but for multidimensional array we use integer array indexing for finding certain value in multidimensional array we have to use indexing like a[1,1] wher first shows the rows and second shows the column of which one to select.if we want to select multiple elements from array we can enter the indices directly into an array function.
   # Boolean Indexing
   boolean indexing allows us to select arbitrary elements based on conditions .if we want to get elements greater than 5 we will use the greater sigh a>5 .this will help us that the the value should be greater than 5.
   
   # Slicing
   slicing is a way to create a subarray based on the original array .to slice we use the : this sign .for examole if we want elements starting from index 2 and ending on index 4 we will use this command a[2:4].if we add another argument to the array a[:2,1:3] we get the first two rows and then the second and third column values only.
   
  # Trying Numpy with datasets
   we have learned the essentials of numpy lets use it on a couplle of datasets.to load a dataset in numpy we will use the genfromtxt we can also spicify datafile name ,delimeter.inside of the genfromtext bracket we have to give the location of the dataset. If we want a range of columns in order, say columns 0 through 3 (recall, this means first, second, and
 third, since we start at zero and don't include the training index value), we can do that too
wines[:, 0:3]. What if we want several non-consecutive columns? We can place the indices of the columns that we want into
 an array and pass the array as the second argument. Here's an example
wines[:, [0,2,4]]. Recall boolean masking. We can use this to find out how many students have had research experience by
 creating a boolean mask and passing it to the array indexing operator
len(graduate_admission[graduate_admission['Research'] == 1])
   
   # Pandas Introduction
   lets look at the way that how to python can be used to manipulate clean and also query data by talking pandas toolkit.pandas created by wes Mckinny in 2008.pandas is a open source project under under a very permissive license.as an open source pandas has got a strong community.with many software developers all making code to help make it better.before pandas we have a hodge podge of tools numpy,the python core libraries.i want to introduce stack overflow pandas uses it as the number one resource for helping new members .if you post a question related to python or pandas the pandas community will respond and the will be given to your question.second resource you can use is that the book.wes mckinny wrote the book called pyrhon for data analysis and published by o'reilly and its recently updated to second verion.i consider this book to look for it.
   # The Series DataStructure
   Now we are going to explore the Series datastructure.we will be doing how to manipulate data ,store data in signle dimensional indexed data in the series object.an easy way to visualize is is two columns of data .the first is the special index and the second is the actual data . data column has has the label of its own and can be used using the .name attribute.
                                                                                                                  
   Now let's make a list of three students alice,jack and molly.
   lets import pandas
   import pandas as pd
   students = ['alice','jack','molly']
   now we just have to call the series 
   pd.series(students)
   
   we see that the values are indexed with integers starting at zero.also the result is a series object and is nicely rendered to the screen .pandas has atomatically identified the type of data in the series as object..
   if we passed in a list of whole numbers we see that pandas sets the type to int34.
   for example=
   numbers = [1,2,3]
   turn it into series 
   pd.series(numbers)
the result we see here is a type of int64 objects.
   there is some other details that exit is that how pandas and python handle missing data.in python we can have a none type to indicate lack of data.consider if we have a string series of list and we add one none value in it then pandas inserts is as a none type and the type object for it.
   4students=['alice','jack','mustafa',none]
pd.series(students)
   if wwe create a list of integers and floats pandas converts this into floating point value known as nan standas for not a number see the below example
   numbers=[1,2,None]
   pd.Series(numbers)
   output is nan and the dtype is float64.
   if we try equality test nan is not equal to none 
   np.nan==np.none the result is false
if we do the equality test to itselt it will result in false.
   np.nan== np.nan
   
   instead we have to use special functions to test the presence of not a number 
   np.isnan(np.nan)
   both meaning is similar but its numeric value and treated differently.
   we can also create a series with dictionary and the index will be automatically assigned to it.
   students_score = {'alice':'physics',
                      'jack' :'physics'}
   s=pd.series(students_scores)
   
   # The Data-Frame
   it is the heart of pandas library it's work is to data-analysis and cleaning tasks.it's a two dimensional series object where there is an index and multiple columns of content. \n 
   import pandas as pd
students = [{'Name': 'Alice',
              'Class': 'Physics',
              'Score': 85},
            {'Name': 'Jack',
             'Class': 'Chemistry',
             'Score': 82},
            {'Name': 'Helen',
             'Class': 'Biology',
             'Score': 90}]
   one method is that you could use a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary 
represents a row of data.



 Then we pass this list of dictionaries into the DataFrame function
df = pd.DataFrame(students, index=['school1', 'school2', 'school1'])
 And lets print the head again
df.head()
   by using the df.head() helps us to show several rows of the dataframe.
   we can etract the data using the loc and iloc attribute.passing a single value to the loc will return the series if there is only one row to return.
   if we wanted data associated with school2 we can just use the .loc attribute with one paramenter.
   df.loc["school"} suppose.# What would we do if we just wanted to select a single column though? Well, there are a few
 mechanisms. Firstly, we could transpose the matrix. This pivots all of the rows into columns
 and all of the columns into rows, and is done with the T attribute "df.T". Since the result of using the indexing operator is either a DataFrame or Series, you can chain 
 operations together. For instance, we can select all of the rows which related to school1 using
 .loc, then project the name column from just those rows
df.loc['school1']['Name'].the .loc alos supports slicing.If we wanted to select all rows, we can use a colon to indicate a full slice from beginning to end. df.loc[:,['Name', 'runs']].let's talk about dropping data.it's easy to delete data in series and dataframes we can use the drop function to drop data from it.df.drop('school1').we can make the copy of the dataframe using .copy() function.copy_df = df.copy().we can also add a new colomn to the dataframe is as easy as assigning it to the value using the indexing operator.df['ClassRanking'] = None
# Fetching Data Through API

This code snippet utilizes the pandas library for movie data analysis. It begins by importing the pandas and requests libraries using the command import pandas as pd and import requests, respectively. Then, a GET request is made to the Movie Database API to retrieve a list of top-rated movies. The response is stored in the response variable through the command response = requests.get('https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/top_rated?api_key=8265bd1679663a7ea12ac168da84d2e8&language=en-US&page=1').

Next, the response data is converted into a DataFrame using pandas with the command temp_df = pd.DataFrame(response.json()['results']). This DataFrame consists of columns like 'id', 'title', 'overview', 'release_date', 'popularity', 'vote_average', and 'vote_count'. The specific columns are selected using double square brackets [['id','title','overview','release_date','popularity','vote_average','vote_count']].

Finally, to display the first few rows of the DataFrame, the code temp_df.head() should be used. However, in the given paragraph, there is a mistake where df.head() is used instead of temp_df.head(). The correct command to display the first few rows of the DataFrame should be temp_df.head(). In summary, this code fetches movie data from a web API, converts it into a DataFrame, selects specific columns, and displays the initial rows of the DataFrame for analysis or visualization.
In this code, we begin by creating an empty DataFrame using the command df = pd.DataFrame(). Then, a loop is initiated using the range function from 1 to 429 (exclusive). Within each iteration, a GET request is made to the Movie Database API to retrieve a list of top-rated movies for a specific page. The page number is inserted into the URL using the .format(i) method. The response is stored in the response variable.

Similar to before, the response data is converted into a DataFrame named temp_df. This DataFrame consists of columns like 'id', 'title', 'overview', 'release_date', 'popularity', 'vote_average', and 'vote_count', which are selected using double square brackets [['id','title','overview','release_date','popularity','vote_average','vote_count']].

The df.append(temp_df, ignore_index=True) command appends the data from temp_df to the existing DataFrame df, with ignore_index=True ensuring the index is reset for the combined DataFrame.


# Pivot Tables
In this code, we use the pandas library to work with a university ranking dataset. After loading the dataset into a DataFrame, we create a new column called 'Rank_Level' based on the 'world_rank' column. We categorize universities into tiers based on their rankings using if/elif statements.

Next, we create a pivot table to compare rank levels with countries, focusing on the overall scores. The pivot table aggregates the mean score for each country and rank level using the pivot_table() function. We observe a hierarchical DataFrame where countries are the rows, rank levels are the columns, and the mean scores are the values. NaN values indicate that some countries only have observations in the "Other Top Universities" category.

To expand the pivot table, we can include multiple aggregation functions by passing a list of functions to the aggfunc parameter. In this case, we add the np.max function to calculate the maximum score for each country and rank level.
